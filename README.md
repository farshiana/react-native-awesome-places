### Project Description

My first project using React Native. It is a basic project, created with create-react-native-app. It uses common technologies such as es6, redux, react-native-navigation and so on. It runs on Android but not on iOS since I don't have the necessary environment. Backend uses Firebase.

#### `npm install`

Installs project dependencies (to be executed inside functions folder as well)

#### `npm run android`

Runs the app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see React Native documentation).

#### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint on js files

### `ln -sf ../../hooks/pre-commit pre-commit` inside awesome-places/.git/hooks

Creates a symlink for the pre-commit hook
